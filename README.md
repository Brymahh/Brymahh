#### About Me!!

I do have an undergrad in Structural Engineering, but I am geared towards leveraging data science techniques in solving problems and execution of project deliverables. I have  experience utilizing tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBI and Tableau in making data driven decisions and solving problems.
I'm a firm believer of `you can do great things from a small place`.

`I'm motivated to finally update my repo, do some projects before the year runs out. I'm excited already.üòÅ`
