#### About Me!!

I do have an undergrad in Structural Engineering, but I am geared towards leveraging data science techniques in solving problems and execution of project deliverables. I have a range experience utilizing data tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBI and Tableau in business operations.
I'm a firm believer of `you can do great things from a small place`.

-----------
I've decided to finally update my repo, do some more projects before the year runs out. Excited already.üòÅ
